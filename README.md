Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecommunications Company
The creation of a machine learning model to forecast customer attrition in the telecom sector is described in depth in this research. The project's main goals were to pinpoint the variables that affect customer attrition and develop a model for categorizing at-risk clients.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Data Source: A telecom company's customer dataset was used.
Data cleaning: Imputation methods (such as mean for numerical characteristics) were used to manage missing values. Data formats that weren't consistent were fixed (e.g., changing TotalCharges to numeric).
Analyzing exploratory data (EDA):
Histograms and boxplots, among other visualizations, showed the distributions of characteristics among non-churned and churned clients.
Techniques such as correlation analysis were used to investigate feature connections.
Feature Engineering:
To be used in machine learning models, categorical features such as SeniorCitizen were encoded.
Existing features served as the foundation for new ones. For instance, tenure categories (such as 1-2 years, less than a year) may be developed to comprehend turnover trends along a range of client lifespans.
Model Selection and Training
Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Voting Classifier (ensemble method combining multiple models)
Grid search or randomized search was considered for hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.
Evaluation
Models were evaluated using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion matrices visualized the distribution of correct and incorrect predictions for each class (churned vs. non-churned).
Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify features most influential in predicting churn.
Challenges
Imbalanced Classes: The dataset might have a significantly lower number of churned customers compared to non-churned customers. This class imbalance can impact model performance. Techniques like oversampling or undersampling were considered to address this.
Results
The Voting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score of X% (replace with actual score) in predicting customer churn.
Feature importance analysis revealed that factors like contract type, monthly charges, and tenure play a significant role in churn prediction.
The confusion matrix provided insights into model performance for both churned and non-churned customer classifications.
Note:- insights fo the Project is even in Code itself
